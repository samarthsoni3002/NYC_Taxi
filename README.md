# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for a Machine Learning project that aims to predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City (NYC). 
The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately estimates the time it takes for a taxi ride to reach its destination based on various input features.
The dataset includes features such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, and additional attributes that may influence the trip duration.

The project follows the following steps:

Data Collection: Acquired the NYC taxi trip dataset from Kaggle. This dataset will serve as the foundation for our machine learning model.
Dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming features as required.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the data that helped improve the predictive performance of the model. This include creating new features, such as distance traveled, day of the week, or time of day.

Data Visualization: Exploring the data through visualizations to gain insights and understand the relationships between various features and the target variable (trip duration).

Model Selection: Used Linear Regression model for the task and evaluating their performance.

Model Training and Evaluation: Training the selected models on the dataset and evaluating their performance on a validation set. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics was used to measure model performance.


# Requirements
To replicate and run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

-Python (version 3.x)

-Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and analysis)

-Various Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
